   --- Terminating a process ---
    * exit() function from stdlib.h

    void exit(int status);

    status:
        0: successful
        < 0: failure
        > 0: their meaning is application specific.

    int atexit(void (*function)(void));

    whenever function is terminated, atexit() will be called.

    Abnormal Terminations:
    The process can be terminated by signals like:
    SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGABRT.

    SIGKILL ends a process immediately and cannot be blocked or handled by any
    program.

    steps:
        1. process is forked
        2. child sleeps for 3 seconds
        3. parents makes sigaction operations
        4. child sends SIGUSR2 signal which should be blocked
        5. sigsuspend suspends the SIGUSR2 signal
        6. child sleeps for 3 seconds
        7. child sends SIGUSR1 signal which should be caught
        8. sigsuspend is over
        9. catcher catches SIGUSR1 signal
        10. catcher catches SIGUSR2 signal
        11. sigsuspend returns -1 as expected since it is interrupted by SIGUSR1
        12. sigsuspend is over
