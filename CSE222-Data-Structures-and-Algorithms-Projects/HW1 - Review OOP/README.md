## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

The folder also has javadoc documents and report.

To compile and run the program, go to the src folder and enter 'make' command.
