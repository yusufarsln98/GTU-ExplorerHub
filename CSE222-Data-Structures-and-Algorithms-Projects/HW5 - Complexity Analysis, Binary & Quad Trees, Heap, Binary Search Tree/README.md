## Folder Structure

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources and `makefile`
The user has to be in the src folder and run the make command there to see the result of tests.

- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
